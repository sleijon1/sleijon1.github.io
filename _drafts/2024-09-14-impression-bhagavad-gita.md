# The Bhagavad Gita

Creator/Author: Introduced and Translated by Eknath Easwaran.

## Background

So, if you didn't know, The Bhagavad Gita is the most famous Indian scripture of all, according to the back of my copy. I came into contact with this book from listening to Alok Kanoija on Youtube, mostly known as Dr. K. He introduced some concepts from Indian culture and history that I previously had either not known about or had some preconceived notion about what they meant. The concepts that I was familiarized with via Dr. K was Dharma and Karma. Karma has a sort of naive interpretation in the western world that what you do in this world will affect you in the next and that it is a sort of crazy concept that could never be true. But I always try to parse out what a more abstract interpretation could entail and what insights can be gleaned from it. Also, Dr. K explained his interpretation that was much more sober than that so I was intrigued. Much like the question of god I have always found it obvious that of course there is some sort of god. It is just a matter of what you mean by that. There is creation, or at least a perceived creation. And for that perceived creation to exist there must exist something. And that something has to have been originated from somewhere and so there must be some definition of god in the sense that something has been created. The more interesting question is, what is creation? It allows us to focus on the issue at hand rather than arguing with two, dare I say boring, camps of people, the "enlightened" rationalists that could never "believe in a man in the sky, hah!" or the way too naive "how could something so complicated not be thought up by someone" that is also bordering on arrogance since it assumes that our minds are the most complicated mechanism and that are thoughts are the most complicated thing and as such it has to have been the origin of the world. Yikes. Anyways, lets get into it.

## Brief Overview

The book is about Arjuna and Krishna where Arjuna is about to go into battle and he is having a deep conversation with Krishna about worries he has about the situation. Krishna basically explains the way to live as a human as far as I can tell, in the more abstract sense, using concepts such as Karma & Dharma. Aiding Arjuna in his conundrum Krishna describes the various ways that Arjuna can live to become enlightened.

## Key Takeaways

### Karma

The basic idea of karma from reading this book is the following very simple known quote: "You reap what you sow". As the seed is to the tree the thought is to the action. We can not escape this situation. It does not mean we have control of our results or that all that happens in life can be simply altered by your mind state but that what thought patterns you have will result in predictable results for you. And if those thought patterns are not conducive to your self-growth the human potential you possess does not have the ability to grow much like the tree can't grow if the seed is rotten. And so the version of yourself that is currently walking around with its thoughts and resulting actions must die in a sense. It must die and be reborn with slightly new thought patterns. And then it must die again and again until the true you is thriving and well at which point there is no more rebirth and you have reached enlightenment. At least that is my current interpretation of the concept. It could also have a generational meaning in the sense of both genes and psychological effects. I guess it is a well established concept at this point that both nurture and nature are predictors for future results. And thus, karma can even be seen as being passed between generations until it is worked out. It makes sense to me that a healthy tree growing from a healthy seed releases other healthy seeds that also grow to be health seeds.

This interpretation of karma is shared in the west as well to a large degree. Its all a matter of what underlying truth the concept is trying to hit.
