Hi I'm Simon and this is my blog Circular ðŸŸ¢ I make posts about things that interest me, to share views, learn things, wrestle with ideas and improve my communication. Remember that anything you find here is subject to change. I don't subscribe to the idea that you must find out your views and stick to them, life is a learning process and understanding is built upon misunderstanding. Hope you like your read.

The root of all evil is ignorance. My solution is that everyone should become the biggest nerd they possibly can and that is my mission, <span style="background-color: green;">nerdify the world</span>.
