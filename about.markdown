Hi im Simon and this is my blog Circular 🟢. Some quick facts about me:

-   🛠️ I work in IT, consulting, programming, AI, DevOps-ing, finding solutions
-   🧩 I love puzzles, challenges and elegant proofs
-   🏃‍➡️ I like exercising, currently running like the wind (..im pretty slow actually)
-   🤓 I try to aim for the optimal solution and land at good enough instead of aiming for good enough and landing at insufficient
-   🕹️ I like video games
