Hi I'm Simon and this is my blog Circular ðŸŸ¢ I make posts about things that interest me, to share views, learn things, wrestle with ideas and improve my communication. Remember that anything you find here is subject to change. I don't subscribe to the idea that you must find out your views and stick to them, life is a learning process and understanding is built upon misunderstanding. Hope you like your read.

I believe the root of all evil in the world is ignorance. So I believe everyone should become the biggest nerd they possibly can and that is my mission, nerdify the world.
