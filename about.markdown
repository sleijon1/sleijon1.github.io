Hello, the name is Simon. With a neverending curiousity, drive to find the right answers and a vast amount of perseverence my aim is to contribute to our species survival on this planet or another :earth_americas:. I have a masters in data science and really enjoy math, programming, philosophy & science in general. Currently working as an IT consultant with a focus on backend engineering & machine learning. My dream is to be able to make a living following my curiousity wherever it leads. Maybe this blog is the start of that journey!


To infinity and beyond :rocket:
