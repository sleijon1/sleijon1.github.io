This is my first post on this blog. Currently, im trying to figure out exactly how Jekyll works so no groundbreaking content yet. But it does seem to be a pretty awesome static site generator!

You can easily add code boxes like the following:

{% highlight python %}
def nagini(phrase="Sss, I am a horocrux.")
  print(phrase)

nagini()
#=> prints "Sss, I am a horocrux." to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}


For future reference I will leave the template links here since they might come in handy:
